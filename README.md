# stripmap 

This repository is an attempt at translating the stripmap class of the [Schwarz-Christoffel Toolbox for conformal mapping](https://github.com/tobydriscoll/sc-toolbox) from MATLAB to Python. This toolbox was developed by Tobin A Driscoll; its user guide is linked [here](https://tobydriscoll.net/project/sc-toolbox/guide.pdf). Details regarding numerical methods for solving the side-length parameter problem are found in *Schwarz-Christoffel Mapping* by Driscoll and Trefethen.
